    <p>Rules: each player will be dealt one suit and the players make secret bids for the cards in a third suit, which are shuffled and revealed one by one. The cards are valued from one to 13, with aces low.</p><br/>

    <p>After each player makes their bid, the player with the highest bid is awarded the card from the competition suit. In the case of a draw, the players make a second bid for the card, as well as the next one in the deck.</p><br/>

    <p>When prize deck is empty, the player with the higher total of claimed cards wins.</p><br/>
