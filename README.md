-In the case of a draw, showing all the cards in the prize pile?
-Representing the prize pile as a deck of cards rather than the single overturned one.
-Transition after win/lose (ie removing cards from previous round)


-Chat
-Being able to choose your opponent.


- Don't start game until user confirms they understand the rules
- "You won 1 points"
-Showing who won for long
-Starting a new game
-Removing last card after game is over

-If you are the first person to play a card then it looks really weird when your opponent plays their card.


-If your opponent leaves, you might want to know about that!
